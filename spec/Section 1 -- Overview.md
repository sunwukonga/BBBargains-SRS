# Overview

BebeBargains is a platform designed to make the exchange of baby goods and
services efficient and convenient. Modes of exchange are sale, barter, and
donation.

Both iOS and Android apps generated by React-Native MUST be available for free download from the App Store and Play Store respectively.

The backend is written in Haskell and the frontend in React-Native. The
connective glue between these is GraphQL.

An example of a GraphQL request to the server might look like:

```graphql example
{
  listing(id: 4) {
    title
    description
    image-resource
  }
}
```

Which would return the following JSON data:

```json example
{
  "listing": {
    "title": "Applejack"
    "description": "Sleep aid. A tablespoon before bed will put your littl'n to
sleep for the count"
    "ourimageserver.com/collection/xxxxxxx"
  }
}
```

Our GraphQL server is implemented with GraphQL-api in Haskell.

Our GraphQL client is implemented with Apollo Client.

BebeBargains has been envisioned with the following principles in mind:

 * **Clear Specification**: It is difficult to build something if the
   constraints of construction are not well defined. This document is the first
   step toward removing this hurdle.

 * **User-centric**: This specification concentrates only on those features that
   the user will need to meet the core goal of the platform. This is an ongoing
   process of adaption that always begins with the user experience.

 * **Client-specified queries**: Because the user experience comes first, the
   connective glue between the front-end apps and the server must be dictated by
   the team that is closest to the user, i.e. the front-end.
